# v0.8 - 21 January 2019

* Improvements to display for restart backoff
* Fix a race condition affecting daemon restart (Richard Musiol)
* Dependency updates and build improvements


# v0.7 - 26 July 2018

* Modd now has a built-in shell interpreter, which is used to execute commands
  by default. This means modd.conf files should now be fully portable.
* Subprocess execution has been revamped. We now send signals to process groups
  on all platforms, which fixes issues with runners that don't pass signals on
  to children (notably `go run`).
* Deprecate the `exec` shell variant. This is no longer needed now we have a
  built-in shell.
* Add support for PowerShell on all platforms.


# v0.6 - 13 April 2018

* Minor bugfixes and updates

* Updates to docs and minor fixes


# v0.4 - 28 September 2016

* Add an "indir" block option to control the execution directory for a block.
* Fix some formatting issues in notifications (thanks @stereosteve).


# v0.3 - 8 April 2016

* Modd no longer exits when there are script errors on first run. Instead,
blocks with errors will be progressively started when there are applicable
changes.
* +onchange option to prep commands tells modd skip execution on startup, and
run only when there's a detected change. (thanks Thomas B Homburg
<thomas@homburg.dk>)
* @shell magic variable to switch the shell used to execute commands. Current
options are "bash" and "exec". (thanks Daniel Theophanes
<kardianos@gmail.com>)
* Modd now uses an exponential backoff strategy for daemon restarts (Josh
Bleecher Snyder <josharian@gmail.com>)

console to be corrupted. (thanks Yoav Alon <yoava333@gmail.com>)
